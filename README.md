TFG1 (GEB); 1st phase out of 2 in Smart Classroom final degree/research projects.

Task: Development of two sensor kits using IoT technology to measure, on the one hand, air quality and, on the other hand, noise. Study correlations between these factors based on measurements taken in laboratory environments.

This project builds on prior work:
